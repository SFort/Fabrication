# Fabrication - Dump edition

This fork has a simple goal. dump everything that can't be ported to 1.17 in under 60 seconds  
in the process compleatly ditching:  

- any coding standards
- backwards comatability
- support / integration with other mods
- command / UI support
- soft feature failiure
- forge compatability(probably im not testing)

obviously i have absolutley no intention of merging this with fabrication
it's purley indeded as a messy and hopefully temporary 1.17 workaround.

none of the dropped/broken features will ever be re-implemented on this branch  
as that is not the point of this branch
#Dropped Features:
