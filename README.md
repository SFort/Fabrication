# Fabrication - Dump edition

This fork has a simple goal. dump everything that can't be ported to 1.17 under 2 minutes  
in the process compleatly ditching:  

- any coding standards
- logic / understanding of the code
- testing of feature
- backwards comatability
- support / integration with other mods
- command / UI support
- soft feature failiure
- forge compatability

obviously i have absolutley no intention of merging this with fabrication  
it's purley indeded as a messy and hopefully temporary 1.17 workaround.

none of the dropped features will be re-implemented  
as that is not the point of this branch

# Dropped Features:

i wanna play fabrication 1.17 today  
so some of the removed features are perfectly functional
